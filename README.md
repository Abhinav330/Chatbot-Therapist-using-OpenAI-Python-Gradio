# Chatbot-Therapist-using-OpenAI-Python-Gradio


## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python script for an AI Therapist Chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot is designed to engage with users in a supportive and empathetic manner, providing responses to user queries and messages.

## Contents
The repository includes the following components:

### 1. Python Script
- The main script, `chat_bot_custom.ipynb`, is responsible for running the AI Therapist Chatbot.
- It uses the Gradio library for creating a user interface and handling user interactions.
- The script communicates with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user input.
- It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model for natural language understanding and generation.

### 2. Dependencies
- The script relies on several Python libraries, including:
  - `gradio`: Used for building the user interface.
  - `openai`: Provides access to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model.
  - `os`: Allows interaction with the operating system.
  
### 3. Configuration
- To use the script, you'll need to set your OpenAI organization key and API key. These keys should be kept secure and stored as environment variables for security reasons.

### 4. User Interface
- The chatbot user interface is created using Gradio Blocks and allows users to interact with the AI therapist.
- Users can enter their messages or queries in a text box, and the chatbot responds with supportive and empathetic messages.

## How to Use
To use this AI Therapist Chatbot, you need to:
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your OpenAI organization key and API key as environment variables.
3. Run the `chat_bot_custom.ipynb` notebook.
4. Access the chatbot's user interface in your web browser.
5. Start a conversation by typing your messages in the provided text box.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a demonstration of how to create a chatbot using OpenAI's powerful language models. It can be used for various applications, including mental health support, customer service, or general conversation.

Please note that this chatbot's behavior is determined by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model and may not provide professional therapeutic advice. It is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.
